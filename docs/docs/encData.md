# ðŸ”’ Fetching Encrypted Data

:::info
Firmware v0.17.0 is required to fetch encrypted data.
:::

You can use this SDK to fetch certain pieces of secure data from your Lattice in an encrypted format.

:::note
Before you can fetch encrypted data, you need to set an encryption password on your Lattice. You will be asked to do this automatically if you request encrypted data without a password set, but you can always go to `System Preferences -> Security & Privacy -> Encryption Password` to set, delete, or change your device's encryption password.
:::

All requests for encrypted data follow the general format:

```ts
import { Constants } from `gridplus-sdk`

// Set of supported schemas
const schemas = Constants.ENC_DATA.SCHEMAS;

// Build request data
const req = {
  schema: // Specify which schema to use
  params: {
    // Params specific to the type of data being requested
  }
}

const encryptedData = await client.fetchEncryptedData(req);
```

## Supported Types of Data

The following types of data may be requested. You should specify params.

### BLS Private Keys (EIP2335)

You may request an encrypted BLS private key of your Lattice's current wallet by providing the BIP39 derivation path. The data format follows [EIP-2335](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2335).

:::note
Currently, the only available schema is `BLS_KEYSTORE_EIP2335_PBKDF_V4`. As implied by the name, keys may only be fetched with kdf `pbkdf2` and returned data is of format V4. See [this module](https://github.com/ChainSafe/bls-keystore) for more info on EIP-2335 data format.
:::

**Request data:**

```ts
const req = {
  schema: schemas.BLS_KEYSTORE_EIP2335_PBKDF_V4,
  params: {
    path: <number[]>, // Up to 5 u32 indices representing BIP39 path
    c: <number>,      // Optional, number of AES iterations (default=262144)
  }
}
```
